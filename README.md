# fake-product-reviews
<b> Abstract: </b>
This GitHub repository consists primarily of Python, executed through Jupyter Lab.
In this code, I have integrated Natural Language Processing (NLP) into conventional supervised learning approaches employed to tackle fake e-commerce product reviews. I pinpoint key linguistic traits and recognize the writing styles of deceptive authors, who intend to either hike up their products' ratings online or tarnish their competitors'. These established patterns are then identified in the remaining reviews, followed by enhancing the dataset with the insights gained through additional columns. This reinforces the machine learning model's comprehension of the narratives in the review, yielding accuracy gains.
